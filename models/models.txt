Models

Workflow
1) Client proposes a Job
2) A Job contains a Product
3) A Job is linked to a Contract (to make a Production?)
4) A Producer accepts a Contract to deliver a Product


This gives us 5 models:
1) Client
2) Producer
3) Job
4) Product
5) Contract
7) User Activity

and possible a meta-model:
6) Production (contains 1 Job and 1 Contract)
